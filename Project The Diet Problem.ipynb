    "The goal of the __diet problem__ is to find the cheapest combination of foods that will satisfy a collection of daily nutritional requirements. In particular, we are given a set of foods and a set of nutrients. We are also given the cost per serving for each food, and the minimum and maximum daily requirements for each nutrient. In addition, we have the amount of each nutrient in a serving of each food.\n",

    "> The diet problem was one of the first optimization problems studied in the 1930s and 1940s. The problem was motivated by the Army's desire to minimize the cost of feeding GIs in the field while still providing a healthy diet. One of the early researchers to study the problem was George Stigler, who made an educated guess of an optimal solution using a heuristic method. His guess for the cost of an optimal diet was \\\\$39.93 per year (1939 prices). In the fall of 1947, Jack Laderman of the Mathematical Tables Project of the National Bureau of Standards used the newly developed simplex method to solve Stigler's model. As the first \"large scale\" computation in optimization, the linear program consisted of nine equations in 77 unknowns. It took nine clerks using hand-operated desk calculators 120 man days to solve for the optimal solution of \\\\$39.69. Stigler's guess was off by only \\\\$0.24 per year!"
